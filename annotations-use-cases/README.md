# Use cases for annotations from the herbarium community

[2021-10-28] Please add your use cases for annotations in ALA here by making a
copy of the included [template](./use-case-template.md) and filling in the
different sections.

We will have a workshop about annotations early next year (2022), so for now a
title and description of the use case will suffice, but any additional
information that might help people better understand the use case will be
helpful.

When creating a new use case, please create a new Markdown file and copy the contents of the template into it.
